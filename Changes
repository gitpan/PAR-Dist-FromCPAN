Revision history for Perl extension PAR::Dist::FromCPAN.

0.04  Wed Oct  4 09:00 2006
    - Upgraded to Module::Install 0.64.
    All of these changes were provided by Jesse Vincent: (thanks!)
    - Add a "_diag" method, to clean up all the code that checks
      'verbose' and send output
    - Improved dependency resolution
    - for loop was very unhappy as we modified its list on the fly
    - actually PAR dependencies _before_ the thing that depends on them
    - When a module depends on a dual-lifed module that was already in
      the core as of $^V, use the core version. Without this change,
      Module::Build can't be autopared
